// # Exercise 15

// Create a variable called `age` and assign it a numeric value. Use the Conditional (ternary) operator. If the variable is grater or equal to 18, print `You can drive a car`. If the variable is less than 18, print `You are too young to drive`.

let age = 20;
console.log(age < 18 ? "you are too young to drive" : "You can drive a car");
